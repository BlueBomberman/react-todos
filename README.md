# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I followed the traversy media React tutorial, and then tested stuff like: React routing, Redux, Materia-ui components, API calls, ecc..

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Backend
for the backend I used a module called JSON Server, and deployed it on Heroku.
